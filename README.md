## Contributing
  Contributors: 
  I worked on this project alone but I had to use an API Key from a Youtube video tutorial, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEu8_5bYm-w I couldn't figure out why the 5 day forecast data wasn't being shown with my API Key so I tried this key when I was trying to figure out the issue.

## Tests
  The tests below will show how the application is run.
  I didnâ€™t include any tests.
